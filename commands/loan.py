Noted! I will remember that /u/chiefwinamac lent 10.00 USD to /u/Sad-Quit-303!

The format of the confirm command will be:

$confirm /u/chiefwinamac 10.00 USD

If you wish to mark this loan repaid later, you can use:

$paid_with_id 141089 10.00 USD

This does NOT verify that /u/chiefwinamac actually lent anything to /u/Sad-Quit-303; /u/Sad-Quit-303 should confirm here or nearby that the money was sent

If the loan transaction did not work out and needs to be refunded then the lender should reply to this comment with 'Refunded' and moderators will be automatically notified
