Commands to be coded:

->$check /u/user - Checks the specified user and returns any loans where user is either the borrower or lender.

->$loan amount [currency] - Notes that the creator of the comment has loaned the creator of the thread <amount> 
in u.s. dollars, which can be retrieved at a later time. The bot also remembers the thread. [currency] is optional 
and must follow the ISO 4217 standard. For example: $loan 10 EUR

->$paid /u/user amount [currency] - Notes that the creator of the comment has been paid back by user the specified amount 
of money on a pre-existing loan. If no loan has been taken out by the user to the creator of the comment, the comment is 
replied with a warning message. Currency is optional and must follow the ISO 4217 standard. For example: $paid /u/johndoe 50 JPN

->$paid_with_id ID amount [currency] - Notes that the creator of the comment, who controls the given loan, has been paid back the 
specified amount of money on that loan. Any excess money beyond that amount is not propagated to other loans, it's simply ignored. 
This is helpful when you have more than one loan out with a particular user.

->$unpaid /u/user - Sets every unfinished loan from the specified user to UNPAID. Note that posts that are marked unpaid can still be 
affected by $paid summons, and when an unpaid loan is completely repaid the unpaid marker is automatically removed.

$confirm /u/user amount - Replies with a comment that effectively restates the command in extremely clear terms. 
This can be used to make sure that regardless of if a user edits/deletes their confirmation, the bots reply stays 
there as proof. Example: If I were to say $confirm /u/rd_trude $50.00 the bot would respond with something effectively 
stating that I have confirmed that /u/rd_trude has sent me $50.00.
